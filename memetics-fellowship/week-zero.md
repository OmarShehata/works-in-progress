# Code Day Open Memetics Fellowship - Week Zero

This is a 5 week program whose goal is (1) for you to learn new tech skills, and develop a useful project that demonstrates those skills to future employers (2) contribute to the field of open source memetics. The scope of the projects you're working on is small on the technical level, but if we do it right, their impact in culture may be very significant. 

Each week will have target milestones, and some required reading. This first week will focus on onboarding, defining the scope of your project, and getting to know the others in the program. 

### Deliverables

1. **Start a devblog** - this is where you'll keep track of your work & what you're learning as you go. This is for me to keep track of your work & review it, but it will also be useful for when you're doing the final project write up, as well as for potentially collaborating with others or applying for funding. 
2. **Go through the NodeJS semantic embeddings tutorial** ([link](https://dev.to/omar4ur/open-source-semantic-embedding-search-clustering-in-nodejs-23om)) - This is a fundamental skill for any computational social science type of work. A lot of our projects will build on this technique that allows us to numerically compute the relationship between ideas & concepts in culture.
3. **Write down your project in your devblog** - I'll work with you on this. Ideally we want to pick a project that involves the tech skills you want to develop, and one that you're excited about/you understand how it fits into the larger vision
