# CodeDay Memetics Internship

> In the tech industry, we publicly study & document security vulnerabilities. We reward white hat hackers who disclose their work for the public benefit. This transparency helps good actors coordinate on defensive strategies. 
>
> **Human minds can be “hacked” through narratives, and we have no coordinated defenses.**

This is a summer [CodeDay](https://codeday.org/) internship. The goal is for you to make a novel contribution to the emerging field of "open memetics". There is a LOT of low hanging fruit that may have very high impact for society, but that no one is working on, for various reasons. This is the gap we're here to fill. 

The broad categories of the work are:

- **Tooling** — creating open source tools that can track the spread & evolution of narratives in a given network (basically open source versions of things like [Graphika](https://graphika.com/)), tools for transparency & coordination, for surfacing information that people want surfaced  
- **Analysis & research** — finding & answering open questions, and creating predictive models of how things spread in culture, and what they do to the underlying "memetic topography". 
- **Outreach** — actually using these tools in real communities & cultures that you belong to. Ideally create something that can go viral that acts as a way of collecting data & spreading awareness of this work.
