# CodeDay Memetics Internship

> In the tech industry, we publicly study & document security vulnerabilities. We reward white hat hackers who disclose their work for the public benefit. This transparency helps good actors coordinate on defensive strategies. 
>
> **Human minds can be “hacked” through narratives, and we have no coordinated defenses.**

This is a summer [CodeDay](https://codeday.org/) internship. The goal is for you to make a novel contribution to the emerging field of "open memetics". There is a LOT of low hanging fruit that may have very high impact for society, but that no one is working on, for various reasons. This is the gap we're here to fill. 

The broad categories of the work are:

- **Tooling** — creating open source tools that can track the spread & evolution of narratives in a given network (basically open source versions of things like [Graphika](https://graphika.com/)), tools for transparency & coordination, for surfacing information that people want surfaced  
- **Analysis & research** — finding & answering open questions, and creating predictive models of how things spread in culture, and what they do to the underlying "memetic topography". 
- **Outreach** — actually using these tools in real communities & cultures that you belong to. Ideally create something that can go viral that acts as a way of collecting data & spreading awareness of this work. 

## Project ideas

**(1) Bluesky app to semantically cluster all replies to a given thread** 

[Treeverse](https://github.com/paulgb/Treeverse) is an app that can take any post on Bluesky and visualize all replies in a tree format. What we want is something very similar, except displaying the replies semantically clustered.

## Background reading

- [How we crowdsourced 5 million tweets](https://omarshehata.substack.com/p/twitter-shut-off-api-access-users) and the long term vision of that project.

See especially the [attributes & language API](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/about-the-api-attributes-and-languages?language=en_US#bridging) that [Andy_Matuschak](https://x.com/andy_matuschak/status/1780739603617739234) discussed wanting to see someone prototype (no one has yet!!!)

- [The Neighborhood Map & Virtual Feeds](https://alexpacheco.substack.com/p/filtering-the-information-network) - on a better way to find information on social media that can completely change the nature of how ideas spread

> Propagandists will also be disrupted as targeting methods will have changed. Decentralizing the network makes their messaging increasingly inefficient and they’ll have to expand their number of operators for wider presence in more niche neighborhoods. But in neighborhoods where more people know each other, visitors and other foreign actors are put at a disadvantage
