# Works in Progress

This repo is a collection of my ideas & drafts. All ideas here are "free to steal". They are building blocks that I (hope to but) may never get around to publishing.

- you can think of this kind of like having a [now page](https://sive.rs/nowff) except it is update much more frequently & it's collaborative
  - it's updated frequently because this isn't me publishing things when I think they are ready. this *is* the workspace where I work & keep my notes. it is always up to date
