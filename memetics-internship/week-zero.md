# Code Day Open Memetics Internship - Week Zero

This is a 5 week program whose goal is (1) for you to learn new tech skills, and develop a useful project that demonstrates those skills to future employers (2) contribute to the field of open source memetics. The scope of the projects you're working on is small on the technical level, but if we do it right, their impact in culture may be very significant.

Each week will have target milestones, and some required reading. This first week will focus on onboarding, defining the scope of your project, and getting to know the others in the program. 

### Deliverables

1. **Start a devblog** - this is where you'll keep track of your work & what you're learning as you go. This is for me to keep track of your work & review it, but it will also be useful for when you're doing the final project write up, as well as for potentially collaborating with others or applying for funding.

I recommend creating an empty GitHub repo like this one. Or it can be a substack, or personal blog. 
 
2. **Go through the NodeJS semantic embeddings tutorial** ([link](https://dev.to/omar4ur/open-source-semantic-embedding-search-clustering-in-nodejs-23om)) - This is a fundamental skill for any computational social science type of work. A lot of our projects will build on this technique that allows us to numerically compute the relationship between ideas & concepts in culture. Bonus: write a piece of code that can extract all of Emmett Shear's tweets about memetics. You can download [all of his tweets here](https://www.community-archive.org/user/905201).
3. **Write down your project in your devblog** - I'll work with you on this. Ideally we want to pick a project that involves the tech skills you want to develop, and one that you're excited about/you understand how it fits into the larger vision. It should contain an MVP that can be completed in 1-2 weeks, and a few "stretch goals" beyond that.

One project is to take [this visualization](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1908957396371997182) of tweets in concept space, and recreate it using data from Bluesky. The MVP can be completed in one week because it can be done by forking the [Treeverse app](https://github.com/paulgb/treeverse) which shows you how to take bluesky posts and visualize them as a tree, then passing those to the [Nomic atlas](https://atlas.nomic.ai/) API to create that concept space visualization. **One stretch goal** is to make the map update live, instead of doing it on a static snapshot. **Another stretch goal** is to make it so any user can run this on their own feed (which gives the tool the chance to go viral, as people each generate these maps to compare their "cultural bubble" and see their own impact on how ideas spread in their network). 

**The way this fits into the larger vision** is that it creates an accessible web app that allows anyone to analyze the spread of ideas in their network. Writing about it, using real examples from social media will spread awareness about the tech, especially since it's open source, it can inspire others to recreate it for other social networks (like Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube).

4. **Add a link to your devblog to the "list of people" at the bottom of this page** (fork this repo, and open a PR).
5. **Schedule a team meeting** - we'll have 2x a week team meetings (Mondays & Fridays). Let me know your availability on those days.
6. **Join the open memetics Discord** - this is optional but, nice to keep track of what is happening in the wider ecosystem, see link here: https://www.community-archive.org/

### Recommended reading

Please put any questions or important takeaways as you're reading into your devblog!

- [A Beginner's Guide to Culture Science](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/a-beginners-guide-to-culture-science) - longer piece by me, essentially a "memetics theory 101" essay
- [We're submitting a paper about the Community Archive to NeurIPS!](https://communityarchive.substack.com/cp/163294733) - skim this, this the latest piece of news in the open memetics community we're working in.
- [The Neighborhood Map & Virtual Feeds](https://alexpacheco.substack.com/p/filtering-the-information-network) - presents a vision of how social media can (1) disrupt propaganda targeting and (2) accelerate good things spreading. The tools we're building fit very well into this vision. 
- [Geopolitics - Blackbird.AI's Constellation Narrative Intelligence Platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Wixy4aIY9Q) - short 1 min video showing how intelligence companies track propaganda on the internet. We basically want to develop an open source version of this kind of tool. 
- [Cosmos Institute and FIRE are funding early-stage projects that advance truth-seeking](https://cosmosgrants.org/truth) - announced a few days ago, there are some potential grants here for the kind of projects we're doing. Useful to look at as a reference for what types of projects people want to fund.
