# Code Day Open Memetics Internship - Week One

Last week you learned the basics of semantic embedding, and how it gives us an empirical way to measure culture. This week, the goal is to (1) clearly define the scope of your project, and write that down in your devblog (2) complete one milestone towards that project. 

The new technical skill you will learn this week is dimensionality reduction. 

### Deliverables

1. **Learn how to perform PCA for dimensionality reduction** - given a set of semantic embedding vectors, generate a 2D plot (can do this in javascript or python)
2. **Reproduce the figure from Alex Avilla's youtube video** - https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/works-in-progress/issues/63, and write about it. No one has ever done this, and I think it can kind of blow up if you do a write up. Bonus points for making an interactive version (where you can write anything and it generates that plot). [This app](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/good-and-evil-concepts) does the semantic embeddings in the browser so you can deploy this as a 100% static web app.
3. **Try the Choma semantic embeddings API** - https://www.trychroma.com/pricing - this is useful for a server that can store & query embeddings. So if you wanted to, for example, [create this kind of web app](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1874079346748776662) where any user can type anything and you cluster people based on their answers, this is how I would do it. 

### Recommended reading

- [A Geometric Intuition for Linear Discriminant Analysis](https://omarshehata.github.io/lda-explorable/) - gives you an intuitive understanding of how dimensionality reduction works
- [How to build culture tech](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-to-build-culture-tech) - explains a simple idea: if you want to solve a problem, you can create a piece of software to solve it, OR, you can create a piece of cultural technology (aka, a social norm) to solve it. Gives a few examples of this, including a testimony from the founder of Twitch about how a lot of their best product features came bottom up from culture like this.
  - Relevant because that's a big part of what we're doing. We're making open source software & prototypes that, if they become popular, shift the industry / market
- [We can do cultural engineering openly, ethically, and sustainably](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/we-can-do-cultural-engineering-openly) - an account of the University of Zurich incident, and how there's no such thing as "a neutral culture scientist"
- Robin Hanson gave a talk last week about the importance of studying culture (https://x.com/algekalipso/status/1926418434755068158). I don't know if a recording of the talk is available, but this is notable because he's a big voice pushing for this, more & more people are starting to understand the need & urgency of this work
- [How to semantic search the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=imCad_0pWz0) - YouTube video explaining some of the basics of semantic search & how it can change the way we consume content on the internet
